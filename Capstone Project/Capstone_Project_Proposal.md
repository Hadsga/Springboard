#### The Problem

Yelp is an internet portal where customers can review different
businesses like restaurants or stores. The reviews on the site have a
significant influence on the customers choice and the image of a
business. Moreover, the review affects the position in the search engine
i.e. a business with a positive review rather appears at the top of the
list. Therefore, it is important for the providers which factors
determine the quality of a review. It can be assumed that the offers
themselves have the largest influence on the reviews (e.g. the quality
of the food in a restaurant). Furthermore, other factors like payment
opportunities, parking or the type of business in a certain area have
also an influence on the reviews. It is important for a provider to know
which factors besides the actual service determine the quality of a
review to be competitive. The goal of this project is to identify these
factors for restaurants. Based on the findings a business can optimize
the own offerings through additional features. Thereby it´s possible to
achieve an additional competitive advantage because he gets better
reviews and a higher position in the search engine.

#### The Client

The client is an Asian food-chain from China which wants to expand into
the West. The company is not sure in which areas and cities they should
offer their products because they don´t know if there is a demand.
Furthermore, they want to know which additional features are crucial for
the success of their food-chain. Based on the findings they can decide
in which areas they should expand and what additional features they
should offer.

#### The Data

Yelp offers a free dataset that contains 4.1 million reviews and 947
thousand tips by 1 million users for 144 thousand businesses in the UK,
Germany, Canada and the USA. The data set is available through the
following link:

The dataset contains 16 variables with 144.072 observations and the
following information:
